Plans for continuing the C++ learning project:
- Should be bases on a project (in our case, the simulation of N particles in a box)
- Introduce concepts from the STL, safe and good programming practices, and OO and Functions programming
  1. mutation and encapsulation for OO
  2. composition, functors and applicatives for functions
- Template metaprogramming
- Daisy change the course with vizQGP for visualization
