# Functions, Operators, Lambda Expressions, Function Overloading and Variadic Templates

In the last section we learned about variables and types, and a little bit about the type system of C++.
We made an analogy analogy to baking that juxtaposed types and recipe ingredients, and values with quantities of those ingredients. 
We will continue the analogy by juxtaposing functions as the specific instructions you have to follow to bake you cake (or bread).
A cake (program) is uniquely determined by its ingredients, the quantity of each ingredient, and a perscription for how to combine these ingredients.
One code even say that the oven is the compiler!
But enough of a diagression.

In this chapter, we will learn all about functions.
In C++, whatever isn't a variabe is probably a function.
We will discuss the syntax of declaring, defining, overloading and templating functions.
We will finish by writing the `Print` function that was already introduced in the last section, and will be prominantly featured throughout the rest of these notes.
