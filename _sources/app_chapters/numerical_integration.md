# Numerical Integration

In this chapter, we will present several numerical integration techniques, including:
- Riemann sums (left, right, and midpoint)
- Trapezoid
- Simpson's Rule
- Gaussian Quadrature
- Adaptive Quadrature

We will define interfaces that allows one to supply both arrays and function pointers.
