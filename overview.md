# Overview

This document is intend as reference for anyone just getting into scientific computing and needing some help navigating command line interfaces and C++ guidance/training.
You can expect to:
- become familiar with POSIX system command line tools and tricks
- Bash shell scripting
- C++ basics and intermdiates
- Project set-up, especially version controlling and git/GitHub
- Use command line to interface with a compute cluster

The vast majority of these notes will be dedicated to familiarizing you the C++ programming language, is it is the standard for high preformance computing.
To this end, there will be example projects which are intended to demonstrate how to setup more complicated projects.
As a disclaimer, well ahead of time, I am not a fan of inheritance.
The coverage of this topic will be minimal so that anyone that stumbles upon is familiar with some of its idioms like "Curiously Recurring Template Parameters".
Lastly, the presentation of topics here, reflects my personal opinion on what is important:
C++ is a very big and general purpose language, allowing for lots of freedom of expression and emphasis.
