# Overview

This document is intend as reference for anyone just getting into scientific computing and needing some help navigating command line interfaces and C++ guidance/training.
You can expect to:
- become familiar with POSIX system command line tools and tricks
- Bash shell scripting
- C++ basics and intermdiates
- Project set-up, especially version controlling and git/GitHub
- Use command line to interface with a compute cluster

These will hopefully be the first in a set of notes of increasing complexity that prepare researchers to complete complex computation tasks.


Throughout, I will assume that the reader has some amount of familiarity with coding constructs.
I will frequently compare C++ syntax with python syntax, as this is quickly becoming the most widely known language among scientists.
